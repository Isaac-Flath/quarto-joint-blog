    "We are writing this blog post to give a few options for adding email subscriptions to blog pages built in quarto in a step by step tutorial.  The [quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html#subscriptions) covers the Quarto part, but does not include steps not related to Quarto with setting up the subscriber list or third party account.  This post is intended to be a step-by-step guide **that fills in the gaps from the [quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html).**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many options for setting this up.  Among them:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ MailChimp: Mailchimp is mentioned in the quarto documentation briefly, but we have chose not to cover Mailchimp as it seems that they are working on deprecating the RSS email feed functionality that is necessary.\n",
    "+ MailerLite: We believe this is a strong alternative to MailChimp.  Easy to set up and easy to use.\n"
